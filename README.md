# Cybersecurity-Threat-Detection
Cybersecurity threats are a growing concern in today's digital landscape, making it
essential to have accurate detection systems to identify harmful activities. This project
focuses on cybersecurity threat detection using the UNSW-NB15 dataset (link), which
contains attack and normal traffic data. We will implement and compare AI methods
including SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks, to identify attacking
activities. By evaluating key performance metrics, we aim to determine the most
effective model for threat detection.
